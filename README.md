Specification for Task Manager Code

1. Overview:
The Task Manager Code is responsible for assigning tasks to workers in a distributed system. It acts as a central coordinator, receiving tasks from a task queue and distributing them to available workers. The code should be designed to handle multiple workers and ensure efficient task allocation and execution.

2. Core Classes and Functions:
2.1 TaskManager Class:
- Purpose: The TaskManager class manages the task allocation and distribution process.
- Methods:
  - `__init__(self, num_workers: int)`: Initializes the TaskManager with the specified number of workers.
  - `add_task(self, task: Task)`: Adds a task to the task queue.
  - `start(self)`: Starts the task allocation and distribution process.
  - `stop(self)`: Stops the task allocation and distribution process.
  - `get_task_status(self, task_id: str) -> str`: Returns the status of a specific task.
  - `get_all_task_status(self) -> Dict[str, str]`: Returns the status of all tasks.

2.2 Worker Class:
- Purpose: The Worker class represents a worker in the distributed system.
- Methods:
  - `__init__(self, worker_id: str)`: Initializes the Worker with a unique worker ID.
  - `start(self)`: Starts the worker to listen for tasks from the TaskManager.
  - `stop(self)`: Stops the worker from listening for tasks.
  - `execute_task(self, task: Task) -> str`: Executes the given task and returns the result.
  - `get_worker_status(self) -> str`: Returns the status of the worker.

2.3 Task Class:
- Purpose: The Task class represents a task to be executed by a worker.
- Properties:
  - `task_id: str`: A unique identifier for the task.
  - `task_data: Any`: The data required for the task execution.

3. Task Allocation and Distribution Process:
- The Task Manager should maintain a task queue to store incoming tasks.
- When a task is added to the task queue, the Task Manager should check the status of available workers.
- If there are idle workers, the Task Manager should assign the task to an idle worker and update the task status as "In Progress".
- The assigned worker should execute the task and return the result.
- Once the task is completed, the Task Manager should update the task status as "Completed" and store the result.
- If there are no idle workers, the task should remain in the task queue until a worker becomes available.

4. Dependencies:
- The Task Manager code should use the SuperAGI project (available on GitHub) for web scraping and summarization tasks.
- The specific dependencies required from the SuperAGI project should be documented and installed accordingly.

5. Error Handling:
- The Task Manager code should handle errors and exceptions gracefully.
- If a worker fails to execute a task, the Task Manager should mark the task as "Failed" and reassign it to another worker (if available).
- The Task Manager should have a mechanism to handle worker failures and remove them from the available worker pool.

6. Performance Considerations:
- The Task Manager code should be designed to handle a large number of tasks and workers efficiently.
- The task allocation and distribution process should be optimized to minimize latency and maximize throughput.
- Considerations should be given to load balancing and task prioritization if required.

7. Testing:
- The Task Manager code should be thoroughly tested to ensure its correctness and robustness.
- Unit tests should be written to cover all core classes and functions.
- Integration tests should be performed to validate the task allocation and distribution process in a simulated distributed environment.

8. Documentation:
- The Task Manager code should be well-documented with clear comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each class, function, and method.
- Usage examples and code samples should be provided to assist other developers in understanding and utilizing the Task Manager code.
